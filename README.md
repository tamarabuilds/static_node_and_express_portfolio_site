Unit 06 project for the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree. This project utilizes Node.js and Express to create a modern portfolio showcasing the projects I've built. There is a landing page, an 'about' page, and a series of project pages.


## How It's Made

Tech used: HTML, CSS (proided by Treehouse), JavaScript, Express, Node.js and Pug

I used npm to manage packages necessary for the project. This includes express and pug so you'll need to run 'npm install' in the project folder if you want to run the files locally.





## Optimizations

Simply click around the page to see my portfolio or learn more about me.

## Lessons Learned

Picked up a bunch of skills including:
 * Building an express server
 * Efficiently setting up gitpages for my projects
 * Importance of standardizing my READMEs

## Extra Features

* Cusomized package.json file so that running 'npm start' will run the app.
* Renders helpful PUG templates in the error-handling middleware.
  * When the status property is a 404, a 'page-not-found.pug' template is rendered.
  * For any other status code, the 'error.pug' template is rendered.
* Structure, style and CSS were updated:
  * Updated font to Lexend to improve readability. Learn more: https://www.lexend.com/
  * Background image updated
  * Box shadows added
