          p Dedicated to having an impact, most of my career involves making technology actually work for organizations. Later, I took another approach and grew strong readers by 3rd grade. Recently, I've found absolute joy in coding solutions myself in JavaScript, Python, Kotlin, HTML, and CSS. 
          p Thanks for looking at my portfolio. Feel free to reach out with any questions whatsoever.
